# 📝 Task List Web App

A clean and interactive **To-Do List Web Application** built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript** without any frameworks.
The project focuses on learning **state management, DOM manipulation, UX design, and persistence** — concepts that directly translate to modern frameworks like React.

🚀 **Live Demo:** https://task-list-kappa-ruddy.vercel.app

# 🧠 App Mental Model

The app works by:

1. Reading user input
2. Creating task elements in the DOM
3. Appending them to the task list
4. Managing task state (completed / active)
5. Persisting data using LocalStorage

Important concept:

> The DOM reflects the state — it is not the state itself.

### 💾 Persistence

* Tasks stored in **LocalStorage**
* Data remains after page refresh
